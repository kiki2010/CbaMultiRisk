    "fireTitleExplanation": "How fire risk is calculated",
    "fireExplanation": " Fire risk is estimated using our artificial intelligence model. \n The model analyzes environmental data such as air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed to evaluate conditions that may favor the spread of fire. \n The data used is obtained from the nearest weather stations. \n Based on this analysis, the risk level is classified as Low, Medium, or High and is represented using colors for easier interpretation.",
    "floodTitleExplanation": "How flood risk is calculated",
    "floodExplanation": " Flood risk is estimated using our artificial intelligence model. \n The model processes data including rainfall amount, precipitation intensity, humidity, and the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) to assess the likelihood of flooding. \n The data used is obtained from the nearest weather stations. \n The resulting risk level is classified as Low, Medium, or High and is displayed using colors for clear visual understanding.",
