    "fireTitleExplanation": "How the fire risk is calculated",
    "fireExplanation": "We developed an Artificial Intelligence model to estimate fire risk.\n This model analyzes environmental variables such as temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed to evaluate conditions that may favor the spread of fire.\n The data is obtained from the nearest and most up-to-date meteorological station.\n Based on this analysis, the risk is classified as Low, Medium, or High and is represented with colors to make it easier to understand.",
    "floodTitleExplanation": "How we calculate flood risk",
    "floodExplanation": "The app analyzes rainfall and humidity conditions to help you understand the flood risk in your area.\n Factors such as the amount and intensity of rainfall, soil moisture, and the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) are taken into account, using data from the nearest and most up-to-date meteorological station.\n With this information, we estimate the probability of flooding and classify the risk as Low, Medium, or High, accompanied by colors for quick and clear reading.",
